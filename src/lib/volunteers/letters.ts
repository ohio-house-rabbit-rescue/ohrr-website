// Copied from ohrr-app/src/features/volunteers/letters.ts — keep the two in sync.
// Hours letters, written from the record.
//
// Volunteers need proof of their hours for different people: a school giving
// credit, a commander putting a service member forward for the Military
// Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, an employer's volunteer-grant
// programme, or just "to whom it may concern". Each letter here is built from
// the volunteer's details and the hours recorded on the day they were given —
// nothing is typed, so nothing is guessed — and every one of them thanks the
// volunteer.
//
// The letter says what OHRR can vouch for (who, how many hours, when, doing
// what) and no more: an award or credit is always the other side's decision.
// It names the person rather than guessing their pronouns.
//
// Plain TypeScript with no app imports: the website keeps a copy.
