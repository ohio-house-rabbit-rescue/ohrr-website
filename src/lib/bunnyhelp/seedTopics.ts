    what_to_do: `## First, rule out a health cause
OHRR’s litter box guide says a sudden change in habits — especially after spay/neuter — is worth a vet visit to rule out a urinary tract infection or bladder problem. If the change is sudden, or your rabbit seems unwell, call a rabbit-savvy vet.

## Common reasons OHRR and its resources list
- Not spayed or neutered yet: hormones drive marking. Spay/neuter is the first step to reliable litter habits.
- Something changed: a move, a new pet or person, a new routine. Rabbits mark territory when their world shifts.
- The box changed: a new litter brand, a moved box, or a box that isn’t cleaned as often. Make any change gradually.
- Age: young rabbits have less control; adolescents (about 4–6 months) mark; older rabbits may need a box with lower sides.

## Retraining
- Put hay in one half of the box — rabbits like to eat while they go.
- Move the box to where the accidents happen, and add a second box if needed.
- Confine to a smaller space (OHRR suggests a 4×4 pen) and expand it gradually as habits improve.
- Clean the box at least every other day with vinegar, baking soda, or an animal-safe cleaner.
- A few poops outside the box is normal territory-marking, not a training failure.`,

    what_to_do: `## The box
- A plastic cat litter box that fits inside a 4×4 pen works well. A low storage tub or dog-crate tray suits older rabbits with achy joints.
- Fill one half with litter and the other half with hay — bunnies like to eat while they go, and it encourages hay eating. Refill the hay daily.

## Safe litter
- Paper-based litter (such as CareFresh) or shredded newspaper; kiln-dried pine or aspen pellets.
- Avoid clumping litter, clay, cedar, non-kiln-dried softwoods, and corncob — they can be breathed in or eaten.

## Training
- Spay/neuter first — it makes the biggest difference.
- Start in a confined 4×4 space; put the box where your rabbit chooses to go.
- Expand the space gradually as habits hold. Praise successes; a firm ‘No’ only if you catch an accident in progress.
- Clean at least every other day with vinegar, baking soda, or an animal-safe cleaner.`,

## Bunny-proofing
- Baseboards sit right at nose level — cover them with wooden boards or plastic guards.
- Wires: move them out of reach, block access, or run them through protective tubing.
- Carpet: tightly woven carpet resists damage better than shag; an area rug is easier to replace. Corners get dug most — a litter box in the corner can help.
- Furniture: protect legs and cushions, and block the space underneath.

## Approved outlets
- Cardboard boxes, stuffed toilet-paper and paper-towel rolls, a box of shredded paper or play sand for digging.
- Willow or twig chews (pesticide-free, non-toxic only) and small-animal toys.

## Teaching
- Speak bunny: a clap or a thump redirects attention, then offer an approved toy right at their nose.
- Supervise until the boundaries stick. Spay/neuter also reduces destructive chewing and digging, per OHRR’s spay/neuter guide.`,

- Both rabbits must be spayed/neutered, then wait a few weeks for hormones to settle.
- Let your rabbit pick: OHRR suggests meeting 2–3 potential partners — personality matters more than size or breed. OHRR runs guided bonding sessions (see Bunny Services in this app).

## At home
- Keep the two pens about 3 inches apart; place food bowls facing each other at mealtimes.
- Hold ‘dates’ in neutral territory such as a bathtub — the footing prevents serious injuries. Start with 10–15 minutes and grow from there.
- Always supervise. Keep a broom or spray bottle handy to interrupt a fight — never use your bare hands.
- Petting both bunnies during a session helps keep them calm.

## What’s normal
- Nipping, mounting (dominance), and pooping near the pen edges (marking) are normal and fade as the bond forms.
- Expect setbacks and ‘bad dates’. Bonding can take months.
- For tough pairs, OHRR suggests stress bonding: a car ride, sitting on a running washer, a basket carry, or a stroller walk together.`,

## Going back a step
- Make sure both are spayed/neutered and it has been a few weeks since surgery.
- Return to short, supervised dates (10–15 minutes) in neutral territory like a bathtub.

- Unlimited grass hay, refreshed daily. OHRR feeds Oxbow timothy; orchard grass and oat hay also work depending on your rabbit’s taste.
- A rabbit should eat a pile of hay about the size of its body every day. Hay’s fibre keeps the gut moving and wears the teeth down.
- Alfalfa is for babies and underweight rabbits — OHRR reserves it for gaining weight, not for adults.

## Pellets
- Plain timothy-based pellets only (OHRR suggests Oxbow or Small Pet Select). No corn, seeds, or colourful pieces.
- OHRR’s rule of thumb: about 1/8 cup per 4 lb of rabbit per day, and many rabbits do fine on less. Pellets are a supplement — hay is the diet.

    summary: 'OHRR’s Top Ten Tips for new bunny owners, in short.',
    what_to_do: `- A rabbit-savvy vet is your new best friend — rabbits are exotic pets with different needs from dogs and cats.
- Get them fixed: spay/neuter cuts aggression and other unwanted behaviour and lowers cancer risk.
- Inside the house, not a hutch: indoors protects from disease, predators, and weather — and you’ll see their personality.
- Housing: at least a 4×4 space on the floor with no wire bottom. An exercise pen works; some owners give a whole room.
- Bunny-proof: secure cords, baseboards, house plants, and anything harmful.
- Litter box: rabbits naturally pick one spot. Use paper-based litter; avoid cedar and non-kiln-dried pine.
- Play: at least an hour a day outside their space, plus a variety of safe toys.
- Diet: limited pellets, unlimited hay, daily vegetables; treats about a teaspoon per 2 lb.
- Do your research — read about GI stasis and bloat and have an emergency plan.
- It’s a commitment: rabbits can live 8–12 years. Enjoy it.`,
