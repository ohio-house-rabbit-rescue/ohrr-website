// Share kit — ready-to-post cards. The point: a volunteer with no design or
// social-media skill picks a rabbit / event / message, taps Share, and a
// branded image plus a written caption go to Instagram, Facebook or TikTok.
//
// Education cards are OHRR's own guidance in plain words, aimed at the people
// the market research says OHRR is missing: families before Easter, young
// renters, students, and rabbit owners who never adopted. Keep facts checkable
// (no invented statistics); each card notes where its claim comes from.
//
// This is the website's copy of the app's src/features/share/templates.ts — keep the two in sync.
