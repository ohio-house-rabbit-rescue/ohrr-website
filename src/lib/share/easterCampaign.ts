// The Easter campaign: every spring, OHRR's before-Easter education posts and
// its after-Easter "talk to us before you give up" posts go into the post
// queue as drafts, dated from Easter Sunday, with one tap in Staff → Posts —
// and a reminder when Easter is close and nobody has done it yet.
//
// No table of its own: each draft's `source` says which Easter and which slot
// it is ("easter:2027:-5w"), so planning twice never adds a second copy. The
// drafts then go through the usual approval like any other post.
//
// This is the website's copy of the app's src/features/share/easterCampaign.ts — keep the two in sync.
