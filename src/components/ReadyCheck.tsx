// "Is a rabbit right for us?" — the two-minute check (2026-09-24). OHRR's
// research: rabbits are given up almost always for human reasons, so teaching
// people before they buy keeps rabbits out of rescues and in their homes.
// Every question and every "why" line is taken from OHRR's own article
// (care_articles `is-a-rabbit-right-for-us`, which staff edit under Care guides
// & pages) — if that article's facts change, change these to match. Nothing
// is stored or sent; the answers stay on the visitor's screen.

    why: 'A rabbit lives 10 years or more. That is a middle-schooler’s whole childhood.',
  },
  {
    id: 'space',
    q: 'Is there room indoors for a space at least 4 feet by 4 feet, with time out of the pen every day?',
    why: 'Rabbits live indoors, with time out of the pen every day. A hutch in the yard is not a home.',
  },
  {
    id: 'adult',
    q: 'Will an adult own the daily care: hay every day, the litter box, and noticing if the rabbit stops eating?',
    why: 'A rabbit that stops eating is an emergency. If the plan is “the kids will take care of it,” a rabbit is not the right pet yet.',
  },
  {
    id: 'handling',
    q: 'Are you happy with a pet that mostly doesn’t like being picked up?',
    why: 'Rabbits are prey animals: fragile and easily startled. They show love by sitting near you, not by cuddling on demand.',
  },
  {
    id: 'proofing',
    q: 'Are you ready to bunny-proof cords, baseboards and carpet corners?',
    why: 'Rabbits chew and dig. Cords, baseboards and carpet corners need bunny-proofing.',
  },
  {
    id: 'vet',
    q: 'Can you get to a rabbit-savvy vet, and budget for set-up, monthly supplies and a yearly check-up?',
    why: 'Not every vet treats rabbits. There is a set-up to buy, hay, pellets, greens and litter every month, and a check-up every year.',
  },
  {
    id: 'home',
    q: 'Will your home, and your plans, have room for a rabbit for years to come?',
    why: 'Rabbits are given up almost always for human reasons: a move, a new baby, a home that was never set up for a rabbit.',
