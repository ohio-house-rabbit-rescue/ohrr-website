// Field schema + legal agreement for the in-app rabbit intake form, mirroring
// OHRR's official Owner Surrender & Relinquishment form and Good Samaritan
// Rescue/Surrender & Relinquishment form
// (ohiohouserabbitrescue.org/about-us/admissions/...). Submissions land in the
// staff Inbox as 'surrender-intake'. The app and the website carry the same
// copy of this file — keep the two in sync.
//
// The owner agreement text is verbatim from OHRR's form. The Good Samaritan
// agreement adapts the same policy to a finder who doesn't know the owner.
